# HighchartsBundle

This is fork of the [ObHighchartsBundle](https://github.com/marcaube/ObHighchartsBundle)
with support for PHP 8.2.

`HighchartsBundle` eases the use of highcharts to display rich graphs and
charts in your Symfony application by providing Twig extensions and PHP objects
to do the heavy lifting. The bundle uses the excellent JS
library [Highcharts](https://www.highcharts.com).

DRY out your chart code by writing it all in PHP!
